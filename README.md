Each problem is separated into folders. 
Problems are all coded in C++ using Visual Studio Code 2022.

Some problems have both parts separated, some have both solutions completed in one VSCode solution (most likely only the second part is there because I added on to it after part one). 
(It will differ for 2024 and the future where I will ALWAYS separate the two).

Not all problems were completed.
